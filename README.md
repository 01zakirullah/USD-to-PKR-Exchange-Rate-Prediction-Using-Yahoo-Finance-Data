# USD-to-PKR-Exchange-Rate-Prediction-Using-Yahoo-Finance-Data
In this project machine learning algorithms were implemented in Jupyter Notebook to find an accurate model which can predict exchange rates. The five models used and accuracy metrics compared are Decision Tree Regressor, ANN, LSTM, SVM Regressor and Neural Network using different variations of layers and neurons.
